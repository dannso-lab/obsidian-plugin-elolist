# here be dragons

this is not a really battle tested solution yet...use at your own risk for now

Will keep track of priorities using elo ratings. New items will have an incubation time that doesnt pin their elo until their is enough information which should help against items staying for too long in the wrong spot if they deviate too much from the default elo.

# install

1. Create codeblock with the tag `elolist`
2. add items line by line

# usage

1. use buttons on the bottom to keep asserting which item has more priority
2. repeat regularily...
3. have fun
